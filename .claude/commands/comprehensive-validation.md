Work on the to-stable branch.
## General Rules (apply throughout):
- Always use az cli to check if resources already exist in the resource group ingen-test before provisioning.
  - If the resource exists, retrieve keys/permissions.
  - Only provision the cheapest viable resource in ingen-test if missing. Do not use resources from other resource groups. Only use Bingen-test.
- Always check that docs align with your actual setup experience.
  - Update only if incomplete, inaccurate, or missing.
- You are allowed to debug Ingenious library code if blocked.
- Commit Ingenious code changes incrementally in small, focused commits.
- Never commit test_dir/ or ingenious_extensions. Make sure to create ingenious_extensions in test_dir/ and not as part of the Ingenious codebase.

### Sequential Steps
Step 0 — Bootstrap
1. Create test_dir/ and cd test_dir/.
2. Follow README.md fully to bring up the environment.
3. Use az with resource group ingen-test.
4. Before provisioning anything, check if resources exist and retrieve access. Provision only if missing.
5. Do not commit test_dir/.
---
Step 1 — Local Docs
- Verify that README.md and docs/ match the local setup experience.
- Update with gotchas, fixes, and debug steps from test_dir/ if needed.
- Keep examples terse and copy/pasteable.
---
Step 2 — Authentication (Basic + JWT)
- Ensure Basic Auth and JWT Auth both work locally.
- Add minimal code changes and concise configuration examples if needed.
- Validate with curl.
- Update docs/auth.md or README.md only if missing or inaccurate.
---
Step 3 — Azure SQL + Blob Integration
- Within test_dir, add and test:
  1) Azure SQL for chat history persistence
  2) Azure Blob for prompt storage
- Use az cli to check or provision.
- Validate the bike-insights workflow with SQL + Blob enabled via curl.
- Update docs/guides/complete-azure-deployment.md if needed.
---
Step 4 — Cosmos DB Integration
- Validate Cosmos DB integration within test_dir.
- Use az cli to check or provision Cosmos DB.
- Retrieve keys/permissions if it exists.
- Verify workflows with Cosmos DB using curl.
- Update docs/guides/cosmos-db-deployment.md if needed.
---
Step 5 — Knowledge-Base Agent with Azure AI Search
- Validate that the knowledge-base-agent works with Azure AI Search.
- Use az cli to check or provision Azure AI Search.
- Retrieve keys/permissions if it exists.
- Verify with queries against the agent.
- Update docs/guides/azure-ai-search-deployment.md if needed.
---
Step 6 — Transition Local → Azure Docs
- Check if docs/guides/complete-azure-deployment.md explains moving from local to Azure SQL + Blob.
- If not, add/update with:
  - Env var table
  - az cli one-liners (with check-before-provision guidance)
  - Minimal provisioning instructions
  - curl verification snippets
---
Step 7 — Custom Workflow (with Auth)
- Create a custom workflow in Ingenious.
- Validate end-to-end execution with Basic + JWT Auth.
- Update docs/guides/custom-workflows.md if needed.
- Include config/code examples and curl commands.
---
Step 8 — Full API + Prompt Testing
- Systematically test all "prompts/" (i.e. routes containing prompt/ or prompts/ as part of the route) API endpoints
- For each prompts/ endpoint, run a curl command
